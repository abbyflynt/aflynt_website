In this course, both simulation and data visualization\nwill be taught through the lens of statistical computing using the\nadvanced statistical software language R.\nThe learning objectives for MATH 230 are the following:\nStudents will become efficient and proficient coders in the\nstatistical language R (including the use of RStudio and\nRMarkdown).\nStudents will deepen their understanding of introductory statistics\ntopics through simulation based learning and nonparametric methods.\nStudents will learn how to create graphical displays of multivariate\nand complex data. They will learn to effectively discuss these displays\nand their uses and misuses.\nReflecting on the course, one thing I am really proud of is how well\nstudents learned to “Google stuff.” It was important for me that my\nstudents understood how often\n\n“experts” need to\n\nGoogle things. Early in the semester before we learned much about\ncoding, students had to  complete a\nGoogle Challenge to figure out the code that completed some simple\ntasks.\nAs another example, on the first day that I taught students about\nggplot2, I showed them the very basics of the “Grammar of\nGraphics” and layering, and then for homework, gave them the following\nplot to recreate (which I recreated from a\n\nWhat’s going on in this Graph post ):\n\n\n\nNearly every student was able to perfectly recreate the plot (after\nbeing given the HEX code). This task continued on their two take home\nexams, where one problem was to recreate a graph that they had never\nseen before. Students were able to use Google to find really interesting\nways to customize their Shiny apps (see for example:\n\nthis and\n\nthat) and their final distill websites (see for example:\n\nthis and\n\nthat).\n\n\n\n",
