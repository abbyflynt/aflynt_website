In this course, both simulation and data visualization will be taught through the lens of statistical computing using the advanced statistical software language R.\nThe learning objectives for MATH 230 are the following:\nStudents will become efficient and proficient coders in the statistical language R (including the use of RStudio and RMarkdown).\nStudents will deepen their understanding of introductory statistics topics through simulation based learning and nonparametric methods.\nStudents will learn how to create graphical displays of multivariate and complex data. They will learn to effectively discuss these displays and their uses and misuses.\nReflecting on the course, one thing I am really proud of is how well students learned to “Google stuff.” It was important for me that my students understood how often  “experts”  need to  Google things . Early in the semester before we learned much about coding, students had to  complete a Google Challenge  to figure out the code that completed some simple tasks.\nAs another example, on the first day that I taught students about ggplot2, I showed them the very basics of the “Grammar of Graphics” and layering, and then for homework, gave them the following plot to recreate (which I recreated from a  What’s going on in this Graph post ):\n\n\n\nNearly every student was able to perfectly recreate the plot (after being given the HEX code). This task continued on their two take home exams, where one problem was to recreate a graph that they had never seen before. Students were able to use Google do find really interesting ways to customize their Shiny apps (see for example:  this  and  that  ) and their final distill websites (see for example:  this  and  that ).\n\n\n\n",
